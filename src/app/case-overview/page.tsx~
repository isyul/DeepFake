                These fake advertisements used AI-generated videos and manipulated images to make it appear as if he endorsed casino apps like 'Manny Pacquiao Online Casino Game' and 'VIP PH.' \
                Despite Pacquiao's public denials, these ads misled thousands of users, many of whom were drawn into scams believing they were investing in a legitimate product. \
                This case highlights how deepfake technology can be weaponized to exploit a public figure’s reputation for financial gain.",

                These videos, designed to mimic real news broadcasts, even used AI-generated versions of well-known news anchors to make the report seem authentic. \
                Upon closer examination, deepfake analysis tools flagged inconsistencies in lip-syncing and unnatural speech patterns. PAGCOR had to issue a public statement debunking the claims, \

                MrBeast is widely known for his philanthropy and extravagant giveaways, making him an easy target for scammers looking to exploit his generous reputation. \
                The deepfake videos were highly convincing, using synthetic voice cloning and AI-generated visuals to imitate MrBeast’s speech and mannerisms. \
                Victims of the scam were directed to fraudulent websites where they were asked to provide personal information and make small 'processing fee' payments—only to receive nothing in return. \
