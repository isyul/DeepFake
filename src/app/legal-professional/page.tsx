                As deepfake technology evolves, governments and IT professionals face increasing challenges in combating its misuse.
                This section explores how legal frameworks and technological solutions are being used to address the ethical,
                security, and legal threats posed by deepfakes.

                <p className="mt-4 text-gray-300">
                    Governments worldwide are attempting to regulate deepfake technology, though legal frameworks are still evolving.
                    The main challenges include defining what constitutes harmful deepfake content, determining liability, and enforcing penalties.
                </p>

                {/* Subsection: Existing Laws and Approaches */}
                <h3 className="mt-6 text-xl font-semibold">Existing Laws and Approaches</h3>
                <p className="mt-4 text-gray-300">
                    Some countries have enacted specific laws to tackle deepfake-related crimes. For example:
                </p>
                <ul className="mt-4 text-gray-300 list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
                    <li><b>United States:</b> Several states, including California and Texas, have laws banning malicious political and explicit deepfakes.</li>
                    <li><b>China:</b> Introduced regulations requiring deepfake content to be clearly labeled to prevent misinformation.</li>
                    <li><b>European Union:</b> Proposed the <b>Artificial Intelligence Act</b>, which includes rules on deepfake transparency.</li>
                </ul>
                <p className="mt-4 text-gray-300">
                    Despite these efforts, enforcement remains difficult. Deepfakes can be generated anonymously and distributed globally,
                    making it challenging to prosecute offenders under a single jurisdiction.
                </p>

                {/* Subsection: Legal Challenges and Enforcement Issues */}
                <h3 className="mt-6 text-xl font-semibold">Legal Challenges and Enforcement Issues</h3>
                <p className="mt-4 text-gray-300">
                    Deepfake laws must balance <b>freedom of expression and protection against harm</b>. Some key legal challenges include:
                </p>
                <ul className="mt-4 text-gray-300 list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
                    <li><b>Proving Harm:</b> Victims must demonstrate that a deepfake has caused reputational or financial damage.</li>
                    <li><b>Jurisdictional Issues:</b> If a deepfake is created in one country but affects individuals in another, legal action becomes complex.</li>
                    <li><b>Difficulty in Identifying Creators:</b> Many deepfakes are generated by anonymous users, making prosecution difficult.</li>
                </ul>
                <p className="mt-4 text-gray-300">
                    A notable example is the <b>Bruce Willis deepfake case</b>, where a telecom company used an AI-generated version of the actor in an advertisement without direct involvement.
                    This sparked debates over whether individuals own digital versions of themselves.
